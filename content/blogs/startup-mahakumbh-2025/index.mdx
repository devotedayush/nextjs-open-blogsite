At the latest Startup Mahakumbh 2025 in New Delhi, Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal gave a frank critique of India’s startup sector, calling for a strategic shift away from consumer-facing startups towards deep-tech innovation.

## A Call for Deep-Tech Innovation

Minister Goyal emphasised a worrisome trend: while China is making headway in fields such as semiconductors, robotics, and electric mobility, Indian startups are largely occupied with food delivery and instant-commerce offerings. He wondered if the entrepreneurial energies of India are being invested in ideas that create long-term value or just respond to short-term conveniences.

## Concerns Over Foreign Investment Dominance

Goyal also showed concern regarding the foreign capital domination of Indian startups. He pointed out that foreign investors are acquiring or making big-ticket investments in several successful startups, resulting in the loss of local ownership and control. He cited instances such as Zepto and Flipkart, which have high foreign investment.

On the other hand, others came to the defence of the existing Indian startup focus. Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha pointed out the jobs and economic impact of his firm:

## Government Initiatives to Encourage Innovation

In an effort to promote innovation in high-technology industries, Goyal launched the Startup MahaRathi Challenge, with ₹70 crore in prize money, to promote new startups in areas such as cybersecurity, AI, robotics, and biotech. The challenge is meant to offer finance and guidance to early-stage startups to scale and contribute to India's technological growth.
